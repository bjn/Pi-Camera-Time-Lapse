I tried to script out a good chunk of system installation stuff to help keep things fairly simple. With that said, I welcome feedback about how to make this better.\r\n\r\n#### Step 1: Clone this repository\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/projectweekend/Pi-Camera-Time-Lapse.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Step 2: Authorize Dropbox account\r\nTo automatically upload time-lapse images to Dropbox, you must authorize your account with the Pi Camera Time-Lapse Dropbox app. I made the the following website to handle this process and generate a key file you will need to save on your Raspberry Pi: [http://pi-camera-time-lapse.herokuapp.com/](http://pi-camera-time-lapse.herokuapp.com/). Once the `dropbox.txt` file is downloaded, save it the root of the project directory: `Pi-Camera-Time-Lapse/`.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Run install script\r\n\r\nFrom the project directory `Pi-Camera-Time-Lapse/`, run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./install.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This step will probably take several minutes to complete. When the script starts to install [Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/), you will receive a warning message. It will prompt you to type the following message to confirm the installation: `Yes, do as I say!`. You must type it exactly.\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Reboot\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo reboot\r\n```\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## Making a time-lapse\r\n\r\nTime-lapse sequences are controlled using job files written in [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). This file describes everything needed to execute the time-lapse. Job files must be saved in the directory `/home/pi/time-lapse/jobs` and prefixed with `job_`. If multiple files are found, they will be processed one at a time. When a time-lapse has completed, the job file will be moved into the archive folder: `/home/pi/time-lapse/jobs/archive`.\r\n\r\nThe `time-lapse` service runs in the background as an Upstart job. As soon as it finds a job file, in the directory referenced above, it will load those configurations and begin taking photos. Since there is no image preview, it's best to run a couple test images on your subject before commiting to a full time-lapse job. To do this, simply save a job file with a `snap_total` of 1. When the resulting image shows up in Dropbox, review it, tweak settings, and repeat until you get what you want.\r\n\r\n#### Example job file\r\n\r\nName: `job_sunset_time_lapse.yml`\r\n\r\n~~~yaml\r\nsnap_interval: 60\r\nsnap_total: 30\r\nfile_prefix: sunset\r\nresolution_x: 2592\r\nresolution_y: 1944\r\nquality: 100\r\nISO: 400\r\nbrightness: 50\r\ncontrast: 0\r\nsaturation: 0\r\nsharpness: 0\r\nshutter_speed: 0\r\nexposure_compensation: 0\r\nexposure_mode: auto\r\nrotation: 0\r\nawb_mode: auto\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nEach of the configurable options in the job file corresponds to a setting in the [picamera.PiCamera](http://picamera.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api.html#picamera.PiCamera) object. Any setting not specified in the job file will use its default value in *picamera.PiCamera*.\r\n\r\nIf you want to disable automatic Dropbox uploading, add the following line to the config file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nauto_upload: Off\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### AWB_MODES List\r\n\r\nI dug these out of `PiCamera.AWB_MODES` so you don't have to. Use these values in your job file for the `awb_mode`. The default, if the property is not set, is `auto`.\r\n\r\n* `auto`\r\n* `cloudy`\r\n* `flash`\r\n* `fluorescent`\r\n* `horizon`\r\n* `incandescent`\r\n* `off`\r\n* `shade`\r\n* `sunlight`\r\n* `tungsten`\r\n\r\n#### EXPOSURE_MODES List\r\n\r\nI dug these out of `PiCamera.EXPOSURE_MODES` so you don't have to. Use these values in your job file for the `exposure_mode`. The default, if the property is not set, is `auto`.\r\n\r\n* `antishake`\r\n* `auto`\r\n* `backlight`\r\n* `beach`\r\n* `fireworks`\r\n* `fixedfps`\r\n* `night`\r\n* `nightpreview`\r\n* `snow`\r\n* `sports`\r\n* `spotlight`\r\n* `verylong`\r\n\r\n#### IMAGE_EFFECTS List\r\n\r\nI dug these out of `PiCamera.EXPOSURE_MODES` so you don't have to. Use these values in your job file for the `image_effect`. The default, if the property is not set, is `none`.\r\n\r\n* `blackboard`\r\n* `blur`\r\n* `cartoon`\r\n* `colorbalance`\r\n* `colorpoint`\r\n* `colorswap`\r\n* `denoise`\r\n* `emboss`\r\n* `film`\r\n* `gpen`\r\n* `hatch`\r\n* `negative`\r\n* `none`\r\n* `oilpaint`\r\n* `pastel`\r\n* `posterise`\r\n* `posterize`\r\n* `saturation`\r\n* `sketch`\r\n* `solarize`\r\n* `washedout`\r\n* `watercolor`\r\n* `whiteboard`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
